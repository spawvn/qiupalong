A small app to show F1 champions by seasons, along with detailed info on round winners.
  
### Constraints:  
- Vanilla ES6
- No frameworks / libraries
- No dependencies
- Does not need build tools, runs as is  
- Single page app

### Features:  
- Show F1 champions by season
- Initial screen has a loading animation
- Upon click, show all round winners for a season, with champion's wins highlighted
- Ability to add/remove a racer to/from favourites, data saved to local storage and is visible upon application reload

### Notes:
- Given the constraints introduced by the task and the ones I came up with myself, I have chosen to use this style of coding. Please do not assume that I develop everything using vanilla JavaScript. Sometimes a usage of a framework is the best choice, and sometimes it's just shooting sparrows with a cannon.
- All JavaScript is written in the same file, for the sake of ease of streamlined examination.
- I left some comments in the code, but generally I believe it is pretty self-explanatory and simple.
- I know there can be found a decent amount of places where the code could be optimized, but I believe in the current setup there are no real performance impediments, so nothing to lose our sleep over.
- As for design, I used minimalist approach, since I am not designer, I just made sure things are not ugly.
- Last but not least, using a proper font face makes your app look ten times more decent, with little to no effort.
